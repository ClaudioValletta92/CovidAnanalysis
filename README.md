# CovidAnanalysis
Jupyter notebook regarding the analysis performed for the AIM week, industry exchange model.
The problem that we had to try to solve was the following:
Covid-19 provides a lot of (reliable and unreliable) data about the disease spreading and the governmental actions in a holistic framework. The data is available on a daily and region/country resolution since January 2020.
Given the data, the goal is to answer the following questions:
• Are the government actions related to the disease spreading?
• Can we predict the actions a government takes? What variables are needed to predict the government actions?
• Are there patterns, i.e. countries behave similarly?
• Can we predict the effect of the government actions onto the disease spreading?
(Bonus) What is needed to keep the disease on an acceptable level without destroying the economy?
